# xkcd-downloader
A script to download images from the webcomic site https://xkcd.com/.

This program will create 2 folders in the directory the program is launched from: xkcd_serial and xkcd_async
in my testing, Async has a 4-5x speed increase over serial. I have only tested with ~100 images though.

You can edit lowerBound and upperBound to change the range of images downloaded.
